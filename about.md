# Summary

User-centered design is my passion. 

I believe that collaborative friendly work is the only way to make the best product.

**I Always Find A Way.**
example,

- Is too much Canvas process going on at the main thread? Use [OffscreenCanvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas).
- The client wants Polygon coordinates to be ordered in clockwise order? Use [Shoelace formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula#:~:text=The%20shoelace%20formula%20or%20shoelace,Cartesian%20coordinates%20in%20the%20plane.&text=It%20has%20applications%20in%20surveying%20and%20forestry%2C%20among%20other%20areas.) to tell if a Polygon is created in clockwise order or vise versa.
- and so on...

**The key question I always ask is 'why?' and 'how?'.**
example,

- Drastic Angular major versioning(1.x → 2) was announced. **Why?** Angular Js had a performance issue with data flow and thus lead the Angular team from Google to launch the Angular 2 version.
- **Why** did Angular JS have a performance issue? Angular JS change detection, as opposed to Angular 2, propagated to the parent component, and that lead to perform as many cycles as needed to have a stabilized components tree.
- **How** did Angular 2 solve that issue? Angular 2 separates updating the application model and reflecting the state of the model in the view into two distinct phases.
- and so on...

**Thus** **I like to face and solve challenges.**

**Tools
Github** for Version Control System**,** **Asana** for project management, **Upsource** for code review and pull request, **Sentry** for application monitoring and error tracking, **Zeplin** for design collaboration tool, **Jenkins** for Continous Integration.
